Title: WebbPSF for WFIRST released!
Date: 2016-01-13
Slug: webbpsf-wfirst-released
Summary: The extensions to WebbPSF that will allow it to compute PSFs for the wide field imaging instrument for the upcoming WFIRST mission have been released. Here are some resources for using them.

On November 20, 2015, [Marshall Perrin](http://www.stsci.edu/~mperrin/) and I released version 0.4.0 of the [WebbPSF software package](http://pythonhosted.org/webbpsf/), making it a valuable tool for preparatory studies for the [WFIRST mission](http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

In brief: WebbPSF, the astronomer's PSF simulation tool for JWST, now supports the WFIRST WFI (Wide Field Instrument). Furthermore, it can apply field dependent wavefront aberrations across the (immense) WFI field of view. There is also a new Jupyter Notebook-based graphical interface for computing PSFs with various input spectra and field positions, for users that would rather not script calculations themselves.

Here are some places you can learn more about this software:

  * [WebbPSF v0.4.0 release notes](https://pythonhosted.org/webbpsf/relnotes.html#rel0-4-0)

I've also created printed materials and given some presentations on this functionality:
